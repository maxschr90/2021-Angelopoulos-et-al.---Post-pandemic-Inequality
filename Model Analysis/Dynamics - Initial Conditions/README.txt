This folder contains the code to simulate the various transition paths, starting from different initial conditions.
It requires as input the files "Path_Baseline_v1.mat" and "Path_nocap_v1.mat" which are generated by functions in the folder
"Dynamics - Aggregate". Ensure that you have run the relevant precursor files before trying to execute code in this section.

If you are happy that you have created the right files and that they are in the correct folders, you can execute "Initial_Conditions.m"
which is going to loop through the different cases in order. Running this code is likely going to take A LOT of time. There
are 36 different simulations that take around 12 hours each on a PC cluster with 36 cores and 8GB RAM. However, you can
split these different runs up if you have the relevant parallelisation capacity.

Good luck.
