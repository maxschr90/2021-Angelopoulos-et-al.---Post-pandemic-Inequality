The code in this folder creates the simulated model paths referred to in the paper.
"Dyn_Baseline.m" runs the baseline scenario.
"Dyn_Nocap.m" runs the baseline scenario without imposing a consumption limit.
"Dyn_Oneoff.m" runs case of having a one-off pandemic.
The first two of these should take around 24h on a cluster PC with 36 cores adn 8GB RAM. The one-off pandemic is a lot less computatonally demanding
so should ony require a couple of hours.

Good luck!
