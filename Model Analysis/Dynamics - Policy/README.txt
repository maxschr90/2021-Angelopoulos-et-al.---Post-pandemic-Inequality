The code in this folder executes the different policy expereiments described in the paper.
It requires as input the files "Path_Baseline_v1.mat" which is generated by functions in the folder
"Dynamics - Aggregate". Ensure that you have run the relevant precursor files before trying to execute code in this section.
To run them, execute "Dyn_Policy.m". The code will loop over 6 different policy implementations and save the results.
Each policy experiment takes approximately 24 h on a cluster PC with 36 cores and 8GB RAM. However, you can run each experiment in 
parallel if you have the required capacity.

Good luck.
