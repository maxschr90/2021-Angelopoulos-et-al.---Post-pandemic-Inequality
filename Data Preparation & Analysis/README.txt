This folder contains the files necessary for replicating the empirical analysis in the paper.

There are 3 main subfolders in this folder:
	Analysis - contains the do-files used to perform the analysis.
	Data - contains the cleaned datasets.
        Raw Data - contains the raw datasets.
	Outputs - contains any outputs generated by the code.

Before running the code, please not the following:

	1. The data used is the Understanding Society (need to refer to the specific code) and the Wealth and Assets Survey (UKDA-7215), which is available from https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk, conditional on any licencing requirements.

           No special licence was required for this at the time of our analysis.

	2. The code in the analysis section is written in STATA. Some parts of the code, might call for additional packages that might not be installed on your machine.
	   In case of encountering an error, while running the code, please check if the error is caused by a missing package.
	   To resolve the issue, install the required package.

	3. The code is designed with the presented folder structure in mind. It will run smoothest if the same structure is retained.
